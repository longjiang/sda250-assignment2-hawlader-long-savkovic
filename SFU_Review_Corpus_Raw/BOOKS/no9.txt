There are two authors I've looked forward to reading when they have a new book out--Tom Clancy and John Grisham. After A Time to Kill, The Firm. The Pelican Brief, The Client, and to a lesser extent The Chamber, I was ready for the next from Grisham. So of course I spent the money for the hardback version of The Street Lawyer as soon as I could find it.  
 
As usual, I read the first few chapters with great anticipation. But somehow, the interest never developed.  
 
It took me some time to figure out what the problem was. Maybe the main character wasn't developed enough? No, not that. Maybe it was the situation that didn't ring true? Not that, either. The problem was simple--the plot. There was nothing engaging about it. It dragged on, and began to take on the character of a reformer's sermon. The whole book may have been Grisham's charity cause.  
 
As it turned out, I only got halfway through the book. I'm not one who likes to put that much time into a book without a payoff, but in this case I decided to cut my losses. I just don't think it was worth the time to finish. And you know what? I have no desire to find out what happened!  
 
And I haven't considered investing money or time in his next book.
