I could not put this book down. I bought this book before heading out on a 2 day bus trip back to one of the states I grew up part of my life in, grand Montana! It took 2 days to get there and I really dislike Greyhound and if it were not for the cheap ticket price I would never take it anywhere. I knew the trip would be scenic but there would be times that I wanted to get away from it all and settle into a good novel. Well, this one did more than let me settle...I took me by the "tie" and jerked me under! I just could not stop reading it, the plot of all his books are the best of almost any writer out there. He and Michael Chrichton are among the best I have ever read. This book was about a lawyer who worked in a firm as a litigator and was around the most defiant and high up men there were in the city. He had it all, money, car, a beautiful wife, till one day a homeless man came and crashed it all in front of his eyes.  
 
 
It goes from his high life to one of the lower society where he becomes a street lawyer after being fired from his job at the large firm. And goes from there into a suspensful plot and great writing techniques conjure up all kinds of a perfectly attuned story. This writer knows his business, he can take you from fear, to trust and back again in the blink of an eye. I have never been able to stay in a book so long since the Hardy Boys, haha! If you're up for a good read that will have you constantly wanting more and getting it sooner or later, than heres your author and heres your book. Go grab one from the local newstand now...you will not be un-satisfied! Tell em the most avid John Grisham reader in the USA told you to come, and they will know what to get you:
