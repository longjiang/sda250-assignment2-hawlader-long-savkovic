I have read all of Grisham's books and this was by far the most boring one! The story is about a lawyer who gives up his high paying job to help the homeless in an office staffed by 2 other people. There is no mystery to the story. Grisham's books are normally mysterious, can't wait to finish it, a "who done it" style. This book does not have any surprises, its dull. I expected a book like other books (f.i. Pelican Brief etc) he has written. It definitely was not! I would definitely not recommend it to anybody
