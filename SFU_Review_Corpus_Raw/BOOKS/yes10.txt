I read this book and I think if was wonderful. I don't know why you wouldn't read this... It is fantastic. This storie is about a little boy from the mid-evil times. He witnesses his fathers murder. The way Stephen King writes this book, is just fantastic. It is like you are really there. I started to read this book, I couldn't put it down. Not unless I had to go to school or to bed. I recommend this book to many people and I think that if you are reading this you should go out and buy it. I was told to read this book by my mother and as soon as I started it I just couldn't stop reading it. If I could read this book again I would read it. I hope you go out and get the book.... it is fantastic. I think I said that but I just thought that you should know that it is fantastic
