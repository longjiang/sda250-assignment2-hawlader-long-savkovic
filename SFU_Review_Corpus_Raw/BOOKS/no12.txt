I always used to be a loyal Grisham fan, but this book changed all that for me, and I fell I have no choice but to pan this book. This book seems to be the turning moment when he simply stopped being able to write a good novel. The best thing that I can say about this is that it is informative . . . that's it! It does not even attempt to be captivating in any way like his previous books, which really hook you, or even interesting in the least. You leave this book feeling as if you have just gotten out of a five hour lecture about the homeless problem in the United States. This work has non of Grisham's usual suspense and thrill which have always made his books a pleasure to read. Skip it and stick to A Time to Kill, The Rainmaker, or The Runaway Jury
