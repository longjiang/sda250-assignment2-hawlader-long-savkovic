Talk about a change of pace. I've always loved King for his horror. And my other love is fantasy. This is the best of two worlds. When a friend of mine told me that King had writen a fantasy, I was intrigued. And the book lived up to my expectations.  
 
The story tastes sharply of a fairy tale. The good prince, the bad prince, the evil bad guy. The younger prince is jealous of the older brother who will be king. The evil magician works his spells through the weaker, younger brother. The characters are realistic and endearing. The tale keeps you on the edge of your seat. I found it to be a real page turner. I would highly recommend this book to any fantasy lover, it fits the bill, surprising from someone who does horror so well. But it is great.
