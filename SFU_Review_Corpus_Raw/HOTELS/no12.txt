In New York for New Years 2003,  
 
I had chosen to stay at the Essex House because of the millions of dollars in renovation that had been put into the hotel, the location, and the Art Deco decor that I had read about. However, I became soon disappointed once I entered my standard room on the sixth floor facing Central Park.  
 
It appears to me that the renovation money did not go into the standard rooms of the hotel. My room was very small as it was difficult to maneuver within the room's limited space. The room was dull with worn Old English furnishing. There where handles missing off cabinet doors and the room lacked isolation from the outside and neighboring rooms. Moreover, the top bed sheet was stained with some type of substance?! I was expecting the rooms to be furnished in Art Deco style as I had experienced at the Grand Hotel in Nuremberg Germany. The only Art Deco decor that I had observed in the Hotel was in the entrance hall of the hotel.  
 
As a Japanese owned Westin hotel, I had high expectations. I had stayed at Westin hotels before, and was never disappointed until now. The standard rooms lack modern amenities. They appear to be outdated of at least 10 to 20 years. The corridors are decorated with non tasteful wallpaper, and the paint on room doors is often chiped and needs repainting.  
 
At breakfast, I was once again disappointed. The chair cushions where worn and torn, and the seating arrangement was uncomfortable. It was too crowded. The breakfast was far from good as the bacon was dried up and the coffee was dull.  
 
Overall, I am very disappointed with the hotel, however I had a good time for New Years 2003 in New York city!
