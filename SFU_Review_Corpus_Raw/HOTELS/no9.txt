I bid for a 3 star on Priceline in the Lake Buena Vista area. This property is located in Kissimmee on 192 (NOT Lake Buena Vista). The hotel was clean, attractive, pleasant front desk staff. The airconditioning was extremely noisy. There were Bath & Body Works ammenities in the guest rooms. Unfortunately, I would not classify it as "secure."  
 
The first thing I found "odd" were the room doors. There was the normal latch up top, the dead bolt and an extra dead bolt? That seemed odd. Everyday when I returned to the hotel, I found pizza fliers under my door (this is a scam happening in the Orlando area; they obtain your credit card #/# and have fun with it; they attempt to rob you if you order a pizza and they deliver it...).  
 
Security was extremely lax. I saw a security officer once, on the morning I was leaving the hotel, on the elevator. If you were coming into the hotel from the outside, you could gain access from any door without using a room key.  
 
I was scheduled to stay for 6 nites, after 3 nites, I left. I was a female traveling by myself and did not feel safe here. I left and checked into The Hotel Royal Plaza on Hotel Plaza Boulevard where the Security was stepped up.  
 
Although the property was clean and attractive, safety is paramount. I would not recommend this property for this reason, and this reason alone.
