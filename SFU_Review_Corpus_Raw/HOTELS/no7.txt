My husband and I got married in Las Vegas in April 1996. We stayed at the Palace Station because it was a good deal and out of the way of all of the confusion on the strip. We just loved it! Everyone was very kind and helpful. The casino is the best around....the food is absolutely the best! The room was nice , however, we did not spend much time in the room. In Vegas one does not sleep very much in the town that never sleeps!!!  
So, of course, we decided to stay here again on our next trip in 1999. What a mistake! The food was still wonderful, the casino is still the only won I could win ANY money at, but the service was not up to par.  
Our room, with the nasty old carpet and the hole in the bathroom door, was not what I expected after spending so much money for a vacation!  
While inquiring about tickets to a show we were told "I don't know, call them and find out"! As for taking the shuttle to the strip, plan to wait at least 30 minutes to an hour!  
The service on the casino floor was very slow at times. At one point I ordered a drink after tracking down a waitress and she never returned.  
However, I did see her serving the higher priced machines a couple of minutes later. I am a very good tipper, which is very important in this town. On our next trip we are planning to stay elsewhere!
