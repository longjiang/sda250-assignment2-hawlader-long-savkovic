The minute that I pulled up to this hotel, I was awaited by the bell man in their proper blue jackets, welcoming us to one of the greatest cities in the country, San Francisco. This was my first time here, and I knew that staying at the Ritz would certainly not displease me, but the overall stay was much better than what I imagined. There was so much to do just inside the hotel that it made touring the city seem boring. First of all, there are many restaurants located throughout the large hotel. Anything from the garden restaurant, to the little lobby restaurant for tea and cookies, to the award winning dining room, voted the best in San Francisco. Though, beware, look at the prices before you order. Nothing here is cheap, but there is not doubt that it is worth it. After a long day of touring the city, why not go for a swim in the amazing health center? There is an indoor pool, masseuse, and an incredible exercise room fitting all of your needs. Then, stop by the concierge to get a recommendation for the best restaurants in town, if you want to leave the hotel of course. If you are not in the mood to leave your room, there are many hit movies to choose from, and room service is exquisite. Anything from a business trip to a family vacation, The Ritz can make anyone feel satisfied. This hotel has modern amenities, but still keeps the charm and luxury of historical San Francisco. This is certainly an extraordinary hotel which would make any stay in San Francisco an amazing one.
