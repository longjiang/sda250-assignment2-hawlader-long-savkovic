Although I do not personaly own one of these monsters, I work with one every day. You see I am a non-linear video editor, and we have a new G4 Professional paper weight here in our art department. Sure it is nice in theory 520 MB of ram expandable to 1.5 GB, Built in DVD burner, built in Zip Drive, Airport, USB, Pretty Blue and Clear Case. But that is where the fun ends Im afraid. First of all Mac-OS 9 which came with ours is a nightmare see my other opinion titled "OS-?" for an explanation on that. The New macintosh is exactly that a 500 MHZ paper weight. The art director is disgusted with it. Always Crashing, Locking up, Finder dissapearing, DVD Drive dosn't burn right. This computer look nice on the outside but if you want a real laugh hold the DVD Flip Door Open and look at the covered up headphone output and volume wheel on the internal DVD. This was not exactly retooled. Oh yes apple keep cutting thoses corners, your accountants are doing an excellent job. Make sure that their year end bonuses are big. ! This is one fast machine when it is up and running I'll give it that. But it seems to be faster at crashing as well. My overall opinion is that this machine has great potential, however it is almost unusable out of the box.
