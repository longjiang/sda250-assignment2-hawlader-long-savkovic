I was so excited when I was given an iMac for my birthday last year, especially since it is aqua blue. However, I have found lots of flaws with this computer. First of all, it doesn't have a disk drive (the hard square disks), you have to buy that seperately (which runs about 100$!). I couldn't transfer any files from my old computer onto my new iMac without buying extra stuff! I was also not happy with the DVD player, it isn't fast enough to keep up with the DVD itself! The actors lines will go in and out of being dubbed correctly. It is only a slight problem, but it really aggravates me to the point that I have only watched one DVE on it. Not only that, this computer has frequent crashes (about once every week or so). That is a problem in itself, but to make matters worse there is no set of keys that you can press to restart the computer. You have to hold down the power button for about ten seconds for the computer to turn off. A few times even that hasn't worked and I actually had to unplug my computer. However, the computer does have a lot of memory, it is pretty quick, and is good if you don't constantly have to import and export things from your computer. The tech support is very helpful too...however, I have WAY too many friends there considering this is supposed to be a very reliable computer. Overall, I wouldn't suggest this computer, espcially since the world is being run more and more by PC's now (I cannot down load files unless they are in a MAC format...very frustrating).
