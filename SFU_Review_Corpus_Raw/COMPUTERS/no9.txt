Allright I looked at this little computer in the store a couple weeks ago hoping there would be an advancement over the first Imac. Besides a few minor upgrades that just barely met par with technology advancements there were no changes. The sales rep made a big deal out of how there was no fan on the processor and that meant there was such advanced technology. He did not realize he was talking to a man who is an overclocker at heart. If there is no fan all that means is that if there was a fan on the processor then it could be run faster. That means there is wasted hardware potential. Not only do you pay more for these machines but they are set up so as not to take full potential of their power, which is still pretty limited. The mouse design problems have not been fixed and I still think the thing looks like bas 70's art deco. I don't think it is possible to overclock with the hardware in this machine. They aren't made for adjustment and they just aren't that fast. I'm sorry but this machine is just not worth it
