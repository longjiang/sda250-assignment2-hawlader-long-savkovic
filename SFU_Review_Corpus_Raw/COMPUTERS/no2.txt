I purchased the sony PCG-FRV25 on recomendation from a pc sales person. I want it for real estate purposes. But it has been nothing but a total disappointment. The worst thing is it's terribly slow boot speed, and I don't even run a fire wall or any back ground virus checker. Secondly it sometimes locks up and or takes like five to ten minutes to catch up to a web page request. It won't even let me shut it down, it will just hang. It also won't even allow me to burn a back up disk it aborts half way through. I have an old 500 megahertz coppermine desk top, that runs circles around this peace of junk. I am seriously thinking of taking it back and stopping payment on it, but then I have wasted weeks of loading and working with all my programs. Anyway don't say I didn't warn you. And , thereis always a chance that I happened to get a big lemon.
