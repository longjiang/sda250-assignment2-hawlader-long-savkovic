I bought the new Mitsubishi Lancer OZ Rally model in February 2002. My car is silver and since it's the OZ model, it has all the upgrades: rear spoiler, racing console, metal rims, upgraded interior, cd player with 4 speakers, and leather wrapped steering wheel and gear shift. All that for $18,000. And since I accepted the 3-year financing plan, I have 0% interest. So every payment I make goes straight to principal. You just can't beat a deal like that! My car before that was a 2002 Nissan Sentra that I drove until it died. This was my first brand new car ever, and I couldn't be more pleased.  
 
When I started shopping for a new car, I also considered another Nissan Sentra or an Altima, a Mitsubishi Galant, or a Honda Civic. I didn't like the plainness of the Sentra, the Altima seemed too big and "old", the Galant was too expensive for my budget, and the Civic just didn't offer the extras that the Lancer did at the same price. I also liked the Lancer because it was the right size for a 5'4" female. I didn't feel like I was driving a tank.  
 
The thing I like most about the Mitsubishi cars is that you don't have to pay for each option separately. Each model and trim comes with it's own set of options, so you don't end up with sticker shock by the time you pick out what you want. The Lancer is new to the U.S. and it's reliability is still uncertain, but all the other Mitsubishi cars have proven to be reliable and I have faith in Mitsubishi's name. The car drives very smoothly and has a fair amount of pick-up. It can handle speeds up to 90mph without any jiggles or rattles (and probably more but I haven't gone that fast). The gas mileage is 28-32 miles per gallon (wonderful!) and although the car is among the smaller models, it's still comfortable enough for 4 people.  
 
If I could go back and do it over, I wouldn't change a thing. There is nothing about the car that displeases me in any way.
