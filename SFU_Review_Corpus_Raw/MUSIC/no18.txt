I am not a fan of rap. I'm slowly coming around to it, but it takes a lot to impress me, in any genre of music for that matter. Needless to say, I won't be shouting praises for Bow Wow's "Unleashed" anytime soon.  
 
The first track is suprisingly good. It has a nice beat, and the lyrics are of the rap-star breed. Totally danceable, and imagineable as music at a teenaged club.  
 
The second track, Bow's first single off this album, is listenable, but nothing outstanding. The sixteen-year-old Bow Wow's music video to this song is of him taking his driver's test, which just goes to show the audience Bow is rapping to. Adults need not apply.  
 
"Eighteen," the third track is one of the most annoying songs I've heard a rapper sing in a long time. The underbeat is headache-inducing, and even though I've yet to turn eighteen, I can't relate to any of his lyrics, which leave a lot to be desired.  
 
Most of the tracks on this CD are what one would expect. It sounds slightly more mature than "Lil" Bow Wow's album (Bow has dropped the Lil in an attempt to seem more mature) but it still plays to the same, younger fan base.  
 
I understand why pre-teen girls and guys like Bow Wow. For them, he's a rapper close to their age, singing about things that they find cool.  
 
Bow's last track "To My Mama" was meant to be a rap dedicated to (obviously) his mother. It loses it's meaning, at least to me, because Bow enjoys rapping, "My Mama/My road dogg" several times.  
 
But maybe that's the new compliment in rap star language. I guess I'm just not hip, yo.
