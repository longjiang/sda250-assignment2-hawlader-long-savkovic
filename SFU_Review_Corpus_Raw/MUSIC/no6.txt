I bought this album when I read an artical in Rolling Stones magizine. I still think I should have waited until I found it in a store that sells used CDs. Maybe then I would have thought it was worth the money.  
 
The album was supposed to be a movement toward feminest hip-hop... it din't make it. There is one track that I really like though. It is Da Brat with Kelly Price. It is soulful and thought out. I don't like that in this album she sells her body instead of her talent.  
 
This CD is similar to Missy Elliots and Foxy Brown. There is only one real diffrence. This album isn't that good, and those other 2 are. It is WAY diffrent than her first... so don't buy this album if you want the same old same old.  
 
Buy this album new if you have money to burn, or if you want an entire collection of female hip-hop artists and this one puts you all the way there. If you are looking for a good female album, buy Missy instead.
