DJ Kay Slay is the king of the mixtape scene. He has won the Justo Mixtape Award for Best Mixtape DJ 4 year in a row. He has many classic mixtape series such as "The Regulator" & "Renegades". He is also the reason why DJ Clue boycotts the mixtape award because Clue b!tched about now winning the award last year and Kay Slay shut him up with an intimidating call out on one of his mixtapes(even though it seems to me he was really calling out DJ Envy, everyone wants to believe he is calling out Clue because Clue is a bigger name). This is Kay Slay's first commecial mixtape release. Even though He is considered "The StreetSweeper" The Streetsweeper DJ's consist of him, DJ Pruitt and others. Him talking over song in him husty voice can get annoying but his exclusive whether its a new song no other DJ has or an exclusive freestyle, makes up for it. Well enough on Kay Slay Lets get into the review.  
 
1. Intro (DJ Kayslay) - $/$ - This opens with a dedication to Kayslay's father. Kayslay actually raps with Aaron Hall singing in the background. DJ Kayslay sounds terrible as a rapper as he sounds as Darth Vader mixed with Ja Rule. Kayslay is a pretty bad rapper. Also This beat is lazy making this a terrible intro.  
 
2. I Never Liked Ya @ss (Scarface, Raekwon & Fat Joe) - $$1/2 - Face starts off this song spitting some pretty tight rhymes. Raekwon really dissapoints me on this song. I was expection some classic Raekwon flame and I got nothing but a crappy verse. Fat Joe comes up after Raekwon and follows suit spitting stench. The best thing about this song is that face spits first so after he is done you can go to the next track.  
 
3. The Streetsweeper (The Lox) - $$$ - Styles P opens up spitting flames. Basic SP styles talking about brutally killing people and junk but he alway does a good job of it to me. The chorus to this song is wack. Sheek is second and is just terrible. He really doesn't make sence when he raps and his metafores are crap. I think he tries to hard to fix funny with gangsta and it doesn't work at all. Jadakiss comes up last with an average verse. It isn't bad but it isn't nearly what you would expect from Kiss. The beat here is pretty mediocre but it has that D Block feel to it.  
 
4. 50 Shot Ya (50 Cent) - $$1/2 - This starts out with Kayslay talking some super hardcore crap. "I'll smack the f*ckin' sh!t out ya favorite DJ". I've never understood why Kayslay is so made all the time. Now to the song...50 Shot Ya is OOLLDD! I swear this song's been around since last summer. It also isn't the best 50 track out. In a matter of fact I think it's one of 50's worst. This beat gets annoying to me. Couldn't they have found a better 50 Song to put on here. Maybe "Dem Not Ready" by 50 & Sean Paul perhaps?  
 
5. Get Shot the F!ck Up (Mobb Deep & Prodigy) - $$$ - This beat is pretty damn tight but let it be known I hate Mobb Deep. Prodigy in particular. He was at one time hot as hell. Now he as a lazy laid back flow and I hate it. So when he opens up I get what I expect. I sloppy and bad 1st verse. The chorus isn't bad though. Big Noyd goes next and I like his verse. Right now i'd say Noyd is better then P & Hav. Hav goes after Noyd and he spits some pretty sub-par sh!t...Well It's not that bad but it's hard for me to like anything the Mobb does nowadays, but Noyd's verse combined with this beat and some ok spittage from Havoc save it from P's trash.  
 
6. Everybody Wanna Shine (Black Rob, G-Dep & Craig Mack) - $$ - So Will the real Kayslay please shut up! I am getting tired of Kayslay's hardcore blabber already. Black Rob has a crap verse, and next G-Dep has a pretty bad one also. Craig Mack comes up and really rips it though. The chorus goes with Kayslay taking sh!t as usual. I guess instead of talking crap over someone elses song they give him a chorus to run wild on.  
 
7. Too Much For Me (Nas, Baby, Foxy Brown & Amerie) - $$$1/2 - The first single for this album and if you see the video you will notice Nas isn't there. Kayslay and Nas now have beef because Nas didn't show up for the video shoot. It's a shame considering Nas has a sickening verse. I mean Nas kills this thing something ridiculous. Amerie's chorus is pretty average. Baby spits some of his better bars on this track, as Foxy spits crappage. This beat is nice andfits the song perfectly, and Nas's "Oh Yeah's" in the background are a nice touch.  
 
8. Purple Haze (Cam'Ron) - $$$ - If it isn't the beat waster himself! Along with the rest of the Diplomats I've never seen anyone in the history of the rap game just trash so many sickenin beats! This song is another example. This beat is hot as hell! Camron comes on with his lazy @ss flow and stinks it. However this beat is so hot I can still listen to this song. Even the chorus is tight.  
 
9. Freestyle (Eminem) - $$$ - Eminem starts explaining how bad of a mixtape DJ. This freestyle is over the "Love Me" beat off of 8 Mile. This isn't a traditional Slim Shady crazy/funny freestyle. Shady seem to be really p!ssed and he just talks about his involvment in the rap game from rappin to producing for people like Jay-Z & Freeway. Not bad but not what I was expection. I was expecting another "Peg Legged Greg" type of freestyle.  
 
10. The Champions (Doo Wop, Tony Touch, DJ Clue, Funk Master Flex, DJ S & S, Brucie B, Kid Capri & Ron G) - $$ - Doo Wop starts off and spits a pretty tight verse. Tony Toca is next and his bar are straight wack! DJ Kay Slay is next and he spits some angry garbage. S & S I think goes next and spits an average verse. I think Ron G is next and spits a doo doo verse. Kid Capri then comes up and spits an above average verse. Brucie B is on the chorus, and Clue & Funk Flex are in the intro. Apparently Clue & Kayslay have resolved their differences.  
 
11. 7 Deadly Sins (Vita, Angie Martinez, Duchess, Lady May, Amil, Sonya Blade & Remi Martin) - $$$$ - The beat here is tight. Listening to Vita and I beg to know why the hell Murder Inc. chose Charli Baltimore in favor of Vita? Vita really rips this joint. Amillion spits some sub-par lyrics here. Angir Martinez lays it down for the haters and it comes off pretty tight. Vita lets you know who it is on this track on the chorus. Lady May spits the best verse I've ever heard from her, not that I hear much of her. Sonya Blade also spits the best i've ever heard of her. Duchess just straight rips her part. She spits flames here. "Open my mouth/and they respect my diction/You Open ya mouth/and cats wanna let they kids in". If Duchess spits the flame then Remi lets out the inferno. Remi doesn't dissapoint as the best female rapper out there (in my opinion). This is the second best song on the album.  
 
12. New Jack City (Posta Boy, Shells, Grafh, Cassidy & Jae Hood) - $$$$1/2 - The future of the rap game at its finest. Not to mention these 5 spit the best punch line out there. Posta Boy opens up and shows when he was the first rapper from 106th & Park to be retired. He opens up and spits and above-average verse here. Next up is Shells, andhe spits flame. "Yo you boys is silly/Im next says Pac & Biggie/and I'm bout Major Figgaz like Dutch & Gillie/Catch Shells all-star weekend down in Philly/on my hip pack heat like a bowl of chilly." Grafh steps up to the plate and he also spits heat. He follows the chorus of "We Just Can't get along" with "cause a lot of y'all are fakin/1 minute later its a salama lenkum(?)/2 minutes later, its wheres my salami bacon/". The punchline king Cass is next and spits fire. This isn't nearly the best of Cassidy but its still tight nontheless. The prince of D Block Jae Hood comes up to bat and knocks out a homer, like he had a corked bat. This is the best track on this album.  
 
13. Westside Driveby (E-A-Ski, Mc Ren & Kam) - $$1/2 - I Like this G-Funk beat. Ski's verse is aight, not bad at all. Mc Ren's on the other hand isn't a favorite of mine. Kam just spits crap. I like the chorus though.  
 
14. Ima Smack this Muthaf!cka (Nore) - $/$ - What the hell is this? Dirty South Nore?!? He musta spent some time in kentucky. The chorus here is trash, the lyrics here are trash and the beat here is trash. That about sums it up.  
 
15. Angel's Voice (The Flipmode Squad) - $$$ - Bad beat. Rampage spits some really violent lyrics here, even though that doesn't make it good. Busta comes up and rips this song up. This is classic Busta right here. Rah Digga also spits a tight one here.  
 
16. I got U (Styles P & Bristal) - $$ - This is a Bristal song with an SP chorus. Styles's chorus is the only reason this song gets and extra $. Bristal spits two wack verses over a corny beat.  
 
17. Take a Look at My Life [remix] (Fat Joe, Remi Martin & A Bless) - $$$1/2 - This beat is hot as hell. Fat Joe starts off spitting his own version of Special Ed's "I Got it Made". After that he spits some tight bars then it goes into the chorus which isn't good but not bad either. Reminese comes up next and rips it as usual. This isn't her best...far from it but it's still good. A Bless comes up and even though i've never heard of him he rips it. DJ Kayslay comes up at the end ruining it screaming more i'll slap your favorite DJ trash.  
 
18. Coast to Coast gangstas (Sauce Money, Joe Budden, WC, Bun B, Killer Mike & Hak Ditty) - $$$ - Sauce Money starts off and spits a terrible verse. Next up Killer Mike. A pretty tight verse for Mike even though I am not a fan of his. Bun B is next and he does a nice job on this track. Someone comes up just naming different types of guns, then WC comes up spittin fire. Joe Budden also kills this track. Hak Ditty comes up last and spoils the track with a bad rap.  
 
19. Nino Brown (Wyclef & Hollywood) - 0.1$ - TRASH  
 
20. Put that Thing Down (8Ball & MJG) - $$$ - This beat is aight. 8Ball rips this joint up. MJG is a funny dude. He just talks stupid sh!t but it doesn't mess up the song, it fits perfectly. A pretty nice track to end the album with.  
 
I can honestly say there are only 3 tracks that I could listen to on the regular basis. They are "7 deadly Sins" "New Jack City" & "Take a Look at my Life[remix]". Kayslay should have officially released "Month of the Bad Guy pt.2" instead of this trash. That has songs I can actually listen to, such as "When You hear That" by Beanie Sigel, ODB & Peedi Crakk, "7 Deadly Sins", "Fire" by Joe Budden & Busta Rhymes, a couple Lumidee remixes, "Money Mayne" by 50 Cent & Lil Flip, "Get Familiar" by 50 Cent & XL, and "Party Ova Here" by Rah Digga & Lloyd Banks. Instead of picking up this garbage, you might as well hit a street corner up and see if someone is pushin the newest Streetsweepers mixtape instead of picking up this crappy one.
