Da Brat~one of the most original rap and R&B stars out there. She has the funky sass of a rap star, and the elegant class of a woman. Her new cd attracted me from the song "That's What I'm Looking For." It had an amazing beat, cool words, and the music video showed many sides of Da Brat. Her growing up from the young disobedient thug girl, to now a woman, is definitely showed throughout her album. With appearances by Tyrese, JD & Lil John, Ja Rule..and many other great performers, her cd is hard to not listen to repeatedly. Her flows and technique is far different from her other albums. She has matured, as well as her music and lyrical talent. She still holds it down as one of the strongest and outspoken ladies of the hip-hop world today. If CDs full of energy is "what you're looking for", I would recommend artists such as Dr. Dre, Eminem, Ja Rule, and The Cash Money Crew, and Eve. If you liked her before, you'll like her now. So go out and by the CD, you won't regret it.
