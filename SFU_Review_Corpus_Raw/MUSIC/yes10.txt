First of all the Biggie issue, "Similarities in my voice ni**a check the words."-Shyne. Yes, on first hearing Shyne's voice you may think of Biggie, but upon hearing the rest of the album you'll have forgotten all about the the very little similarity, if you haven't you have issues. The difference between Shyne and Biggie, besides the younger and healthier voice of Shyne, is that Biggie was a studio gangsta' where as Shyne is for real. Biggie even said it himself in an interview, he sits with friends and takes their experiences and makes them into songs. You can feel Shyne's album is real, you hear it in his voice, in his lyrics and you can see it in his eyes. He has many scars to prove his battles both inside and out. Trust me besides the lyrics, which Shyne writes himself, you have the hottest beats to hit a hip-hop album in a while. Shyne shows how versatile he is by rapping to fast jungle beats, slow "love" songs, and all those bass pumping tunes. Trust me when I'm driving and I need something to hype me up I throw in the Shyne c.d. because it's truly hot.
