Warning: This opinion is very graphic. It is intended for adults. Minors should not read this opinion. I have used */SYM to make some of the content "clean" but feel that I needed to include the profanity in order to illustrate what I was referring to. I hope that no one is offended by this opinion, and if they are, I sincerely apologize.  
 
Let me preface this opinion by stating I have never before had a problem with profanity in music. I have always preferred to buy the unedited versions of CDs.  
 
Having seen the video for "Get Your Roll On" on BET, I thought I'd enjoy this CD. I liked the beat and liked the lyrics.  
 
Yet, when I listened to the same song on the CD, I was shocked. It sounded like an almost completely different song.  
 
As I already stated, I've never been one to get offended by profanity in music. A lot of my favorite artists use profanity in their lyrics. However, I believe that there is a way to do it so it blends well in the music.  
 
Apparently Big Tymers are not familiar with that technique.  
 
Big Tymers sprinkle curse words in their lyrics in places where not only is it not necessary, but it detracts from the rhythm. Instead of the lyrics flowing, as with Ice Cube or Dr Dre, Big Tymers' lyrics have a stutter quality to them that makes listening to the songs unenjoyable.  
 
Here are some examples of what I am talking about. These lyrics were all taken from the song, "Get Your Roll On".  
 
"Everybody Get Your Roll On,  
Everybody Get Your Mother F**king Roll On"  
 
That is the chorus, it is said four times. The chorus is said many times throughout the song.  
 
Other lyrics are:  
 
"Slap that b**ch,  
Punch that hoe."  
 
"Big d**ks we slang,  
Freak b**ch do your thang, do your thang."  
 
"Your wife is,  
My baby momma.  
God d**n, mother f**ker,  
She's a good d**k s**ker."  
 
While some rappers incorporate profanity into their songs in a way that is seamless and doesn't stand out, the Big Tymers have not mastered the art yet. They've put profanity and insults in their music in places that would have flowed much better without them.  
 
This was proven by watching the video for "Get Your Roll On" on BET. The lyrics in the video flowed and between that and the beat, I couldn't just sit and watch. I had to get up and dance in front of the TV.  
 
The beats and rhythm on the CD are still booming, and such that you will want to dance to them and bob your head to the music. But if you're like me, you will wish there was a switch on your stereo that would allow you to cut the lyrics out and just listen to the rhythm.  
 
The feel I got from this album is that Big Tymers were trying to copy Ice Cube and Dr Dre and other Gangsta Rappers' styles, and failed miserably.  
 
If you like Gangsta and Hardcore Rap, read my review of Ice Cube's new album, "War and Peace: Vol 2 (The Peace Album)".  
 
My recommendation on this album, "I Got That Work" by Big Tymers, is either get the edited version, or just pass it up, and save the money that you worked for.
