When I got married my mother bought me a set of Revere Ware and my mother-in-law bought me a set of Farberware. Each swore up and down that their choice was the best set of dishes on earth. Well after 4 years of testing, I have to say that my choice is Revere Ware!  
 
I found the Farberware to not be so durable. For starters, the handles fell off two pans. Second, I dropped a Farberware pan once and it cracked in the rim. Third, I dropped my farberware skillet and revere ware skillet one day while cleaning. My farberware skillet is now oval not round. My revere ware skillet is just fine. Fourth, I found that the Revere Ware heats through faster and more evenly.  
 
My recommendation to anyone who wants a durable long lasting set of pots and pans - that they choose Revere Ware. My mother has been using her pots for 26 years. They look great and work wonderfully!
