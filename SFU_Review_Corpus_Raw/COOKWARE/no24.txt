As you can see by the title here I'm not a fan of Farberware cookware. Purchased a set in May and it has not held up to its reputation. I don't know what they are doing or not doing, but this set left a bad experience for me.  
Can't go in the dishwasher, can't use oil or sprays in it. It scratches easily and stains and peels. This cookware is not a cooks friend what so ever!! Shipped set back to Meyer corp. and would you believe they didn't stand behind their "Lifetime Limited Waranty" due to their explanation of telling me that is was not defective. Well if peeling and scratching aren't covered under this "WARRANTY" after less than 3 months use then I have no clue what is covered.  
It cost me over $15 to return and they send me back the exact set. Is this customer service? Is this what we buy now is use for less than 90 days and throw the cookware away? If you are considering purchasing this "stuff" I'd think twice. It's not worth the price or the hassel
