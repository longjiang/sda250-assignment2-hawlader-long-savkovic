Yes, Le Creuset is attractive, long lasting and comes in a variety of lovely colors, and are suitable for most heat sources. However, as a classically trained chef and manager of a cookshop, I feel that the disadvantages to owning it far outweigh the advantages. It is obviously extremely heavy on it's own without any food in it, and the price tag is quite hefty as well. Furthermore, if you should happen to chip or crack it in any way, having it re-enameled is as costly as replacing it. Another problem...what if you decide to redecorate your kitchen and it's color scheme? I suggest that you are far better off with stainless steel or anodised cookware. They can be found in a variety of price ranges, suitable for all heat sources, and fit in with all color schemes.
