Do not buy these spoons if you are looking for a decent product.  
 
Yes these spoons are modestly priced, but the quality is highly lacking.  
 
My first impression, was "what the hell are these"  
 
Upon inspection of the spoons they appear to be a cheap type of "pot metal" stamping. The finish on most of the spoons was a flat unpolished grey color. The only part of the spoon that was even remotely shiny was the head of the spoon.  
It looks like a big machine stamped them out and then some poor enslaved Chinese 12 year old was forced to quickly (and unevenly) polish just the part of the spoon you put into your mouth. As was evidenced by each spoon having a very nice "made in China" sticker on it.  
However each spoon on the bottom has unevenly stamped into it the words, "stainless steel" which is about the only indication that these are actually stainless steel. To be honest I think that it is stamped there just to make you believe that they are stainless steel and keep you from immediately demanding a refund.
