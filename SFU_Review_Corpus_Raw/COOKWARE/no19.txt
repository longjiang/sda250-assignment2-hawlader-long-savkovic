Recently got married and registered for the obligatory kitchen "stuff", including a set of calphalon hard-anodized cookware. I must say I am underwhelmed, considering how much they cost.  
 
-- Cool things about the pots 'n pans:  
 
*/SYM Glass lids! I didn't know what I was missing with my old target pots & pans. When cooking, I want to check the status of the food often and the glass lids are a simple but amazingly effective feature.  
 
*/SYM The handles don't get hot when the pots are.  
 
*/SYM While they're not dishwasher safe (see below), they are amazingly easy to clean, cooked in food does slide right off the surface.  
 
*/SYM Very sturdy. You can't knock it off the stove accidentally, and nothing you do to these pots is going to damage them (well, except use metal utensils in them :-)  
 
-- Not so cool things about the pots 'n pans:  
 
*/SYM heaaaavy. I have to use two hands to move the larger saucepan when it's full of water.  
 
*/SYM Not dishwasher safe. Aww, shucks. I've long been one of those people who says "Hey, why bother scrubbing pots if we have a dishwasher, so what if we can only fit 4 things in before having to reload.." so I've found this to be a fairly big drawback.  
 
*/SYM You can't use metal utensils in them - I'm lazy, I used to grab a spoon from the silverware drawer to stir. Now I have to use an actual *gasp* plastic or wooden spoon.  
 
*/SYM Cost. $200 for a *pot*??  
 
So overall, I'm sure the calphalons are great for professional cooks who are constantly making things that require these heavy duty pots and pans (the same type of person who probably pays someone else to wash the dishes), but for the average joe it's probably not worth it. I'd rather buy a set at target and replace it every year for the convenience of being able to put them in the dishwasher and their lighter construction.  
 
The glass lids is the one feature that keeps me using the calph's, so if I ever find a cheaper, lighter, dishwasher safe set with glass lids..
