I have finally found a set of pans that are worth the money I paid for them. I thought I needed a new stove, instead a new set of pans was a better deal.  
I researched all of the different sets available and decided that these pans were the best fit for the money that was available for me.  
I absolutely love the speed at which these copper core bottom pans heat up. I can now boil water in half the time and at a much lower setting that before. The pans are sturdy and I don't feel like the handle is going to come loose as I carry something to the table. I also enjoy the fact that the handles are welded to the outside of the pan, this ensures that there are no rough surfaces on the interior for food particles to adhere to. I also enjoy the ability to cook at high temps with out the sides of the pan heating up. The heat source is concentrated at the base of the pan vice the handle and sides. This is safer and more efficient.  
The only disadvantage I have found so far is the clean up. The instructions say the pans are dishwasher safe but it is not recommended due to possible cosmetic changes in the surface of the pans. My wife used a metal spoon to sir and this left metal scratches in the pan surface. It did not affect the use only the appearance
