All-Clad is the best cookware I have ever used!  
 
My wife and I purchased our first All-Clad saucepan with a gift certificate we received when we were married. Ever since then, we couldn't wait for the day when we could replace our entire collection of old and worn pots & pans with nothing but All-Clad.  
 
A year later, we finally purchased the Stainless Steel Nine-Piece Set and we couldn't be happier.  
 
Here is what the set we purchased contains:  
• 10" Non-stick Fry Pan  
• 2 Quart Sauce Pan w/Lid  
• 2 Quart Saute Pan w/Lid  
• 3 Quart Sauce Pan w/Lid  
• 6 Quart Stock Pot w/Lid  
 
Cooking on All-Clad is a joy. Things cook well, fast & evenly. There is one modification one must make to their cooking style though. KEEP THE HEAT DOWN for sautéing. Following that rule, we have never had a problem with sticking - no matter the recipe. From fried & seared fish to Chicken Dijon - they all turn out perfectly (provided the cook doesn't make any mistakes!).  
 
Everything cooks easily, rapidly, and clean up is breeze. The full length handles NEVER get hot.  
 
Because of the nature of the shiny stainless steel surface, if you expect to keep your All-Clad in its "as new" shiny condition, it's important to clean it well inside AND out after every use. That being said, we managed to leave a lid on a hot burner one night. Fortunately, my wife picked it up with an oven glove but it left a rather large amount of burned oven glove stuck to it. With a good amount of scrubbing, even that came off, leaving the lid looking as good as new.  
 
Our All-Clad have taken a real beating since we purchased them. We have used metal spoons, whisks, spatulas and tools of all kinds. Through it all, not only have they continued to cook wonderfully, but they look good too
