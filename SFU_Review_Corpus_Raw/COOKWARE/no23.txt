I received a Smoothie Elite as a Christmas gift and was mildly appreciative of the gesture, but needed a blender, so I didn't return it. After using it once, I figured out it would never replace a true blender in my kitchen. Now it's just a prop at my bar.  
 
The 500-watt pulse-power motor with 3 speeds (on, mix, and smooth) is loud - almost whiney - more so than other blenders. What does "mix" and "smooth" mean anyway?! Give me high and low and we're talking.  
 
56 ounce / 7 cup capacity is quite sufficient.  
 
Unique stir stick breaks up air pockets, increases mixing efficiency. But this thing is a nuisance - just gets in the way. I usually just keep the alternate removable lid center on it.  
 
The dispenser valve serves smoothies without a mess, but keeps on serving when you don't want it to. From day 1 the valve dripped onto the counter after using it once. It's difficult to clean, as well. You have to disassemble the entire valve - a 15-minute ordeal.  
 
The base is oversized and bulky.  
 
The owner's manual suggests not using a dishwasher to clean. Great...so much for convenience!
