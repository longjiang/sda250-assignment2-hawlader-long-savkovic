I bought this cookware set because I finally graduated college, got married and decided that I was finished using the "cheapies". I decided on this brand because quite a number of professional chefs I know also have these pans in their home kitchens. I was originally very impressed with the set and loved the design and heaviness. After many uses I have now discovered several items worth mentioning to potential buyers. First, on the positive side, I must say that the heat distribution is great and this cookware cooks very evenly. And, as I mentioned before, stylistically they are quite lovely to look at. They add a touch of class to any kitchen. A problem I have discovered and have been greatly disappointed with is the heat retention and conduction of the handles. I have been burned several times now by grabbing on to the handles which appear to have been designed to avoid just such accidents. I don't know why this occurs but it is a hazard and I have to constantly remember to grab a pot holder before grabbing the handle of the pan or pot. I do A LOT of cooking and this is a huge problem for me.
