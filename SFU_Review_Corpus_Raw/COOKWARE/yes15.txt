I got this popper for a Christmas gift last year and it has been one of my favorite items since. It consists of an aluminum pan with a snap on top. the top has 2 flaps with steam vents and a handle. The handle turns a stirrer that is attached to the bottom of the lid. The popper if very well constructed. It is entirely aluminum, feels sturdy and cleans up very easily.  
 
Flat out, this popcorn popper makes some of the best popcorn I've had. It comes out light and fluffy, and very tasty. Using this popper I can actually make popcorn in shorter time than using a microwave. It is cheaper, better tasting and faster...what are you waiting for!! Go buy one right now.  
 
I got mine from www.popcornpopper.com along with some of their gourmet popcorn and real theater popping oil. I would highly suggest these items to go along with the popper
