Pros: Easy to find Talk button.  
Cons: Sound quality is bad.  
 
I have tried this model of cordless phone by Uniden and have brought it back twice to the store because the sound does not work on one of the phones. The volume cuts out when you are talking to someone and then you have to hit it to get it to come back on, which didn't always work.  
 
I would suggest getting another cordless phone besides this one because the volume problems with the handset
