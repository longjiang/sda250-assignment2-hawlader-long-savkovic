I've had the phone for about a week and so far I'm very impressed. Initially, I had a lot of interference on the phone, but then I realized that I had it set up near a wall that had a lot of wiring in it (right behind my house's main electrical panel!). I moved the base station to a different room and it's been great! Sound quality is vastly improved over my 2.4 Ghz Panasonic and there's absolutely no interference with my wireless network. My favorite feature so far is the built-in speaker phone in the handset. That's a life saver when sitting on hold waiting for tech support people. Again, so far, so good. I'd recommend it - especially for people with wireless 802.11b networks.
