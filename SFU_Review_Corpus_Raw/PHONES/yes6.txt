We LOVE this phone!  
With the help of Consumer Reports and Epinions.com reviewers we went out and bought this phone. We had already gone through 2 cordless phones. One we loved most things about, but the handset was uncomfortable & tiny as well as the sound quality being very poor. SOOO we were looking for THE BEST this time.  
 
We feel we found what we were looking for in this phone. The sound is GREAT on both sets & all the features make it very convenient!
