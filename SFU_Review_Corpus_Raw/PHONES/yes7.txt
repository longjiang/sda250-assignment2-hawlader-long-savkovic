Purchased this product this past year after months of research (my wife thought I was nuts - but now she is glad I did - see below). The Internet was the most helpful and convenient way to do this.  
 
We wanted a system that had a corded handset w/digital answering machine for our kitchen and the capability to have at least two other handsets (1 for upstairs 1 for downstairs). We decided to purchase the "kx-tga 273s" additional handset (bedroom phone/alarm clock/radio). Cleaned up our nightstand tremendously - thank god.  
 
I could go into all the numerous features this system offers - but that would take forever. We use the majority of them (the manual explained them in easy to learn terms).  
 
All in all, like the title says "we couldn't be happier" with our purchase and the cons I described are not really cons, just minor inconveniences.
