Full Review 
So I was looking for phones some time before Thanksgiving last year and settled on trying to find Uniden phones. Mostly because they had what I was looking for and they were fairly stylish and cheap. I ended up getting the Uniden TRU-5865 2 pack which has a main cordless phone with a usable speakerphone base (that plugs into a wall outlet and phone jack) and then a satellite base and cordless receiver which only plus into the wall outlet. Let it be known, that I purchased this product off of eBay and that it was a new, refurbished model. I charged the phones up for the suggested time before we started using them. Then I transfered the phone list from our old phones to the new phones (manually of course). We were pretty happy with the phones at first, just the initial excitement of having something new and different. However, it seemed as though the batteries were not holding charge very well. Then we also started noticing that the phone would cut out. You could still talk and the person on the other end could hear you but you could not hear them. It is a good thing we kept our old 2.4Ghz phones because that is what we are currently using. These two problems have caused me to get rid of the Uniden phones. The phones themselves were comfortable to hold, came with belt clips which were handy, and had different ringtones (which we had wanted). However, the inability to use the phone without knowing whether it was going to cutout or not caused all the pros of this product to diminish. It is fair enough to say this may have been a lemon that was supposed to have been repaired to great condition, although the cutting out did not occur for the first couple months. But even so, what does that say about the service and warranty work about Uniden products? So, when I purchase more phones I will most likely not be going with Uniden. I have had good experience with Panasonic and while they are expensive I would like something that works and is reliable. 

Here are some of the details regarding these Uniden phones: 

- 5.8 Ghz DSS technology 
- Up to 2 cordless handsets on same "network" 
- Caller ID • Call Waiting • Speakerphone • Handset Locator • Voice Mail • LCD Display ... PLEASE NOTE: The system itself does not have voicemail it has a light on the handset which indicates whether you have a new voicemail, but you must have voicemail set up with your local phone provider ... it does NOT have an answering machine. 
- 3-way talk capability 
- 10 speed dial numbers 
- up to 100 phonebook numbers able to be stored 
- battery is supposed to last up to 192 hours standby and 4 hours of talk time 
- has a 1 year warranty except refurbished items only have 90 days 
- i believe there are 10 different ringtones/rings you can choose from ... a few classical type song ringtones, we wish you a merry christmas, etc 

There you have it, now you have all the information regarding this phone. I have not had any other contact with Uniden products and this admittedly leaves a bad taste in my mouth. My brother just bought some new Uniden phones and I am looking forward to seeing what his experience is with them. Happy hunting.
