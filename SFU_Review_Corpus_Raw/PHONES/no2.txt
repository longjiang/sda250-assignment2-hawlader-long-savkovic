I bought this because my old Panasonic KX-TCM526BXB which was about 4 years old bit the dust. I started buying cordless phones starting with the cheapest(then returning them and upgrading) to this one which is the most expensive and none has a range of more than 30 yards. My old panasonic used to go at least 50 yards. Also, it should be clearer but it isn't as I found a lot of interference, especially if you move more than 5 yards away from the base.  
The only thing good about the product is it looks pretty
