Pros: Hands-free handset  
Cons: Everything else...particularly the battery life!!!!!  
 
I have had this phone for less than 4 months and the batteries don't even last one phone call. I will charge the phone overnight and all day. When I get home from school I can only make one to two phone calls before the handset needs recharging. This is the absolute worst phone that I have ever had. I wish that I could return it!!!!!!!
