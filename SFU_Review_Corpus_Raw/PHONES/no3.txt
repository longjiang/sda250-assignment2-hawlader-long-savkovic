Pros: Great phone while it worked!  
Cons: Should last more than three year. Have had same problem with other Panasonic phones also.  
 
After three years display on handset died. Cannot recommend for durability an longevity. I have had the same problem with other Panasonic phone systems before. They use to make the best, I will look at other brands in the future.
