We bought this phone to replace a cordless phone we had for about 9 years. The phone we replaced was very cheap but worked perfectly for us until I dropped it into a bucket of water. We looked around quite a bit at all the choices now available. We like Panasonic products so decided to give this phone a try. I wish you could try the phone out at the store because we never would have bought it. The sound quality wasn't good at all for us. While talking, the phone was very echoey...people sounded like they were a million miles away. Thinking it might be our phone line, we took it to a friend's house and the same thing happened. We returned it and got another one (same phone) just to give it another try. Same problem. So, we ended up returning it and finding another model.
