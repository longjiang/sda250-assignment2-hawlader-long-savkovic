Pros: decent speaker phone  
Cons: short battery life breaks easily paint scratches off sounds horrible  
 
I had one for 3 months, and I just threw it away. It had poor sound quality from day 1, and everyone was always complaining to me that they couldn't hear my voice.  
 
Later on, the phone shorted out and the only way it would work reliably is in speaker phone mode.  
 
Also, the fancy painted plastic quickly started looking really bad, as the silver paint scratched easily (especially around the ear area) and left ugly black marks on the phone. Suddenly, the phone looks really really cheap.  
 
Battery life was about 2 hours of talk time, which is ok but you can do better with 2.4ghz or 900mhz phones.  
 
I'm back to an older generation 900mhz phone now, and the voice quality is much better.
