I bought this phone because it had all the features I was looking for (i.e. caller ID, 2.4 GHz range, speakerphone, etc.). Plus I've owned Uniden phones in the past and haven't had a problem with them.  
 
However, this phone has extremely poor sound quality from the handset. It's very hard to hear/understand the person on the other end of the line (even with the volume on high). What makes matters worse is that when you talk into the phone it sounds as if there is an echo which is very annoying.  
 
The bottom line is, this phone is going back to the store today
