Pros: Easy set up/great features/ understandable instructions/ user friendly.  
Cons: Could have made the handset with a more comfortable, less irritating design for ear area.  
 
Instructions are clear and the phone is easy to set up.  
 
The features are incredible. The fact that you can have extension phones all over the house is amazing. The phone book, once set up in any unit can be copied to all other phones.  
 
You can use the phone to page another phone, transfer a call, conference, or use like an intercom.  
 
It has a room monitoring feature, like for a baby's room, or if you were caring for someone who was really sick.  
 
The distance from home with good reception is about 1000 feet. There is a booster feature available but I have not tried it all the way to the hunting shack (reason I chose 5.8 gh).  
 
You don't have to use the "answering machine". If you don't press the "Answer On" button, which is indicated by a red light, you will have a plain old regular phone. I am a little dismayed that the answering machine will only hold 15 minutes of calls. I'll have to remember to clear it more often.  
 
The phone works great once you make adjustments in the setting up of the phone.  
 
It's fun to use.
