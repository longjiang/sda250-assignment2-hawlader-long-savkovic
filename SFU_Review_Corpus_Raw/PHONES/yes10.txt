The fidelity is very good. This was a concern (kinda picky).  
 
The expansion capacity is also a plus.  
 
Range (roughly 100 yards +) is what I would expect, with very little static.  
 
Attractive base unit with large display, easy to use. Intuitive..., well made.  
 
Sorry if the above review sounds a little... guarded. I've purchased several of these devices with a lot of disappointment. But this one is really great! The base unit is corded and the handset sounds like a corded phone. There are mailboxes (3) and a lots of utility regarding privacy, conference, transferring, caller id, call waiting, paging, and even radio contact between several handsets.  
 
For those with really young kids, there is a "baby monitor" mode!  
 
In short, this is a nicely designed phone system with a lot of expansion, sounds great and is priced well.
