Plot Details: This opinion reveals no details about the movie''s plot.  
I drag my friends to see Gothika, why? Because I am a person who loves horror films--all types and the previews looked enticing enough. So off we went to see the film, and overall, I was impressed.  
 
The videography of the film was great. Camera direction, eery set, but I think what made this film was the music. Yes, believe it or not, had the music not been suspenseful and skillfully placed at scenes where the audience got tense, then this film would have been a flop. The music added such intensity, it was similar to what made Friday the 13th films memorable.  
 
Another thing that was great was the acting. Well, I am usually never disappointed with Halle's acting, she is extremely good. But I was quite shock to see her play such a role that was different that her usual roles. It was great! She fell so many times during the movie that I know realize how she broke her arm on the set.  
 
What was not so great about the movie was that there were gaps in the plot. I would like to see more character establishment. Plus, the role that Downey Jr. played was a little unclear--was he an obstacle or not? Also, how did Halle get off from murdering a man? These questions were not really answered.  
 
The idea of the film is not new either. It was like a different version of the Sixth Sense, but in a more perverse way. However, I forgive that because it seemed to work out at the end.  
 
Overall, I would recommend this movie to people who loves to go out on dates, because if she is as squeamish as I, you will be in for a treat.
