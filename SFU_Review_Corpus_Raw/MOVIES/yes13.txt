From Saturday night live to Old School and now to a even better and funnier movie...ELF. Will Farrel plays the role of Buddy which is an unusual elf. An elf that is bigger than usual, has a lower voice that the rest, and is missing the pointy ears. This movie is a very good family movie not just because it's about Christmas but because it has a good message to it. The message that some people have forgotten the true meaning of Christmas and have given up on Santa. Well this is a movie that you would want to see to bring back that Christmas cheer. I have seen this movie twice now and can never stop laughing at Buddy's(Will Farrel) actions to the city. I really enjoy how Will can make a movie without using adult humor. I only have one bad thing to say about this movie...I really don't like the angry elf. Come join Buddy on his quest to find his father.
