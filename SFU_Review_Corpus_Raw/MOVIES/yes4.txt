I caught this movie on the comedy channel today, and want to find it on dvd now, for my collection.  
It's what I'd term the "stupid-funny" style, much like Mel Brooks would make.  
If you're one of those people that's easily offended by non "politically correct" movies, steer clear of this one. If you're capable of laughing at the world, and especially at yourself, watch this movie!
