As an actor, Will Ferrell shows promise for hilarious movies, thus I am driven to see them. From the previews alone, I have been dying waiting for elf to come out.  
 
I found it to be hysterical, as well as touching. My boyfriend doesn't even like Christmas and told me he had goosebumps for the last 20 minutes of the movie.  
 
Is there a lesson to be learned? Does it matter? Christmas is about feel-good movies and when do you feel better then when you are laughing
