Elf is the story of a human who wandered into Santa's bag of toys while he was visitng a orphanage (Will Ferrell). He then grows up to realize that he is not an elf, and ventures out into the real world to find his father (James Caan). He finds him, and at first is not accepted. However, their relationship grows throughout the movie and it a great story, with humor for all ages.  
 
Ferrell's comedy, both physical and witty, is enough to make you fall out of your seat, even if you are sitting on the floor. The situations he gets himself into by his curiousity and naiveness are endless. And the irony of those situations is hilarious. I can remember at least 10-15 distinct times when the whole audience sitting in the theatre laughed out loud.  
 
Although a comedy, this movie does have some touching moments. Heck, it made me cry. Not really cry like big time, but a tear did roll down my cheek, in more than one place. The funny thing is, it was two different emotions. One was sadness, and the other was happiness. Weird, isn't it?  
 
Anyway, I give this movie a great rating for its ability to play with my emotions. Laughter, happiness, sadness, and, yes, even guilt, played into my movie-watching experience when I payed my 9 dollars to watch Elf. Great movie.
