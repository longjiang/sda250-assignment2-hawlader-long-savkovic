Poor Dr. Seuss', he must be rolling in his grave.  
 
This movie stank, stunk, stinks... Mike Myers is a twit that obviously was suffering severely from being in that costume. His acting stank, stunk, stinks.  
 
This movie is NOT for young children, which is rather disappointing because thats who would have watched the movie had it been any good. Kids were asking their parents to leave, and parents were asking falling asleep during the flick.  
 
Sure the special effects were neat, I guess, if you are into those types of things. The jokes were not that funny.  
 
It was NOT worth the money paid. I should have waited until it came out on video and rented it for .99 cents.  
Better yet waited a few years until they played it on some hacked up cable channel.
