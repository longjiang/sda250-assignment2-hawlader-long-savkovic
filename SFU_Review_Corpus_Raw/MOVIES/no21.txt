So much could have been done with this classic story. Instead, the result is major disappointment, a poor attempt to mimic The Grinch (which worked) and other movies of this genre. Myers is a fish out of water, trying hard to liven-up an otherwise dreadful script and story line, and pandering to adults with "oh-so-current" references and innuendo. The mean-spirited character over-played by Alec Baldwin is enough to give nightmares to children familiar with his role as the benevolent Mr. Conductor in the Thomas the Tank Engine movie. Kelly Preston is gorgeous. I was insulted every time the two disturbed children were forced by the Director to "look at the camera, show astonishment, look at each other, then look back at the camera". What a tremendous lost opportunity
