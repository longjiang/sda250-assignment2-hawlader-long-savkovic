This is the worst movie I have seen in recent memory. A lot of people say, "This is a movie for kids, not adults, so don't be so harsh." But even my kids (10 and 14) disliked it. It was "Austin Powers Does Dr. Seuss." It was so bad, I can't even think of a way to make fun of it. The jokes were tired and WAY overdone. The attempts to insert humor for the parents was just painful and out of place. Despite what some people think, a kids movie can be good and appeal to adults, such as Toy Story or Space Jam. My wife is very forgiving when it comes to bad movies, and even she said she wouldn't be buying this one for our video library. What a truly awful adaptation from such a wonderful children's classic.
