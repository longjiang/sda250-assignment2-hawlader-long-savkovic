Plot Details: This opinion reveals no details about the movie's plot.  
The movie is overwrought and overdone. The plot is not the book’s. I know that movies are not supposed to be fully like the book but when practically every child (as well as adult) in America has read the Dr. Seuss books, this is unforgivable. The movies don’t need to be fleshed out with over analytical information about why the Cat is who he is or with the history of their lives, but give it a rest.  
 
The good stuff….the visual production itself with its ultra-stylized appearance. It looks nice, but did the budget of a third world nation need to be spent to create this film?  
 
The plot has added a bunch of new things to it…and who cares. This is a short book which should have remained a cartoon classic on tv. With the holidays upon us and the mass merchandising, the movie is sure to be a hit…too bad as there are some other films that deserve to be seen.  
 
At less than 90 minutes, this movie is definitely too long. You’ll probably have screaming kids who want to see this film….it is on steroids the way it runs all over the place but they may be entertained. Parents have two choices: lie and say the theatre went out of business. Or give in to the children and put up with their disappointment. Stale popcorn would be better than this movie.  
 
Somehow I think this movie will be better on video as seeing it on the smaller screen may make it appear to be less over produced.
